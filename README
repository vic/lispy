Lispy is sexpy Ruby.

Lispy is a lisp dialect resembling Ruby sexp. Actually it's almost ruby's sexp disguised as lisp. 

The idea is this: 
  Given a ruby program, feed it to a parser producing lispy (redleaf). 
    Because lispy is just ruby-sexp it should be really fast to create a lispy 
    expression from a sexp. 
  Optionally allow another lispy or ruby program to modify the lispy expression. 
    In this step it might be possible to modify the original ruby program by 
    working on its lispy representation. Just like lisp-macros do.
  Finally convert the lispy expression to either: 
    - ruby's sexp that can be later compiled to bytecode (rubinius)
    - ruby code that can be interpreted directly.
